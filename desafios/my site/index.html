                <p>Entrepreneur Elon Musk has achieved global fame as the chief executive of electric autos maker Tesla (TSLA), the CEO and lead designer of his space company SpaceX, and, more recently, as the world's richest human.
                Musk co-founded PayPal (PYPL), was an early investor in Tesla, and in April 2022 negotiated a deal to take Twitter</p>

                <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Elon Reeve Musk was born in 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa, the oldest of three children.
                His father was a South African engineer, his mother a Canadian model and nutritionist. <br>
                After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived primarily with his father. He would later dub his father <q>"a terrible human being… almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done."</q> </p>
                   
                   <blockquote cite="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/061015/how-elon-musk-became-elon-musk.asp">“I had a terrible upbringing. I had a lot of adversity growing up. One thing I worry about with my kids is they don’t face enough adversity,” <strong>Musk would later say</strong>.</blockquote>

                <h2>Bullied as a Child</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Musk attended the private, English-speaking Waterkloof House Preparatory School—he started a year early—and later graduated from Pretoria Boys High School. A self-described bookworm, he made few friends in those places.</p>
                <br>
                <blockquote cite="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/061015/how-elon-musk-became-elon-musk.asp">“They got my best friend to lure me out of hiding so they could beat me up. And that hurt,” Musk said. “For some reason, they decided that I was it, and they were going to go after me nonstop. That’s what made growing up difficult. For a number of years, there was no respite. You get chased around by gangs at school who tried to beat the (expletive) out of me, and then I’d come home, and it would just be awful there as well.”</blockquote>

                <h2>Early Accomplishments</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Technology became an escape for Musk. At 10, he became acquainted with programming using a Commodore VIC-20, an early and relatively inexpensive home computer. Before long, Musk had become proficient enough to create Blastar—a video game in the style of Space Invaders. He sold the BASIC code for the game to a magazine called PC and Office Technology for <b><i>$500</i></b>. <br>
                In one telling incident from his childhood, Musk and his brother, planned to open a video game arcade near their school. Their parents nixed the plan.</p>

                <h2>Notable Accomplishments</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Musk was 24 years old when he moved to California to pursue a Ph.D. in applied physics at Stanford University. But, with the Internet exploding and Silicon Valley booming, Musk had entrepreneurial visions dancing in his head. He left the Ph.D. program after just two days.</p>

                <h2>X.com</h2>
                <br>
                <p>In 1995, with<b> <i>$28,000</i></b> and his younger brother Kimbal at his side, Musk started Zip2, a web software company that would help newspapers develop online city guides. In 1999, Zip2 was acquired by Compaq Computer Corp. for its AltaVista web search engine for<b> <i>$341 million</i></b>. Musk used his Zip2 buyout money to create X.com, a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fintech.asp" target="_blank">fintech</a> venture before that term was in wide circulation.
                <br>
                <b>X.com</b> merged with a money transfer firm called Confinity, and the resulting company came to be known as PayPal. Peter Thiel ousted Musk as PayPal's CEO before eBay (EBAY) bought the payments company for <b><i>$1.5 billion</i></b>, but Musk still profited from the buyout via his <b>11.7%</b> PayPal stake. <q>"My proceeds from PayPal after tax were about $180 million,"</q> Musk said in a 2018 interview. <q>"<b><i>$100 million</i></b> of that went into SpaceX, <b><i>$70 million</i></b> into Tesla and <b><i>$10 million</i></b> into SolarCity. And I literally had to borrow money for rent."</q></p>

                <h2>Tesla</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Musk became involved with the electric cars venture as an early investor in 2004, ultimately contributing about <b><i>$70 million</i></b> before joining engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning to help run a company then known as Tesla Motors. After ousting Eberhard in 2007 following a series of disagreements, Musk assumed control as CEO and product architect. Under his watch, Tesla has become the world's most valuable automaker and one if its best known brands.</p>

                <h2>SpaceX</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Musk used most of the proceeds from his PayPal stake to found Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, the rockets developer commonly known as SpaceX. By his own account, Musk spent $100 million to found SpaceX in 2002.
                <br>
                Under Musk's leadership, SpaceX landed several high-profile contracts with the U.S. <strong>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)</strong> and the U.S. Air Force to design space launch rockets. Musk has publicized plans to send an astronaut to Mars by 2025 in a collaborative effort with NASA.</p>

                <br>
                <p>On April 14, 2022, business magnate Elon Musk offered to purchase social media company Twitter, Inc., for <b><i>$43 billion</i></b>, after previously acquiring 9.1 percent of the company's stock for <b><i>$2.64 billion</i></b>, becoming its largest shareholder. Twitter had then invited Musk to join their board of directors, which Musk accepted before changing his mind.</p>
